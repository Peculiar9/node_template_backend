# Database Management and API Integrations

This document provides an overview of how the **Node Express Backend (TypeScript)** project manages databases and integrates with external APIs. The application supports both **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**, allowing flexibility and scalability depending on the use case. Additionally, the **Infrastructure** layer includes various external integrations for seamless interactions with third-party services.

## Database Management

### Supported Databases
- **MongoDB**: Used for managing unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB's flexible schema design makes it ideal for managing dynamic and evolving data models.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database that ensures data integrity and supports advanced querying capabilities. PostgreSQL is used for structured data, ensuring consistency across the system.

### Connection Management
- **MongoConnectionManager**: Manages connections to MongoDB, ensuring that each database operation is handled efficiently. This connection manager ensures pooling of MongoDB connections to minimize resource consumption and maximize performance.
- **SQLConnectionManager**: Handles connections to the PostgreSQL database using connection pooling. This prevents the exhaustion of database connections and ensures that the system can handle multiple requests concurrently.

### Repositories
Repositories are used to abstract data access logic, making it easy to switch between different databases without changing the core business logic.
- **MongoDB Repositories**: Responsible for CRUD operations on MongoDB collections. The MongoDB repository pattern abstracts all data manipulation, ensuring that switching to another database or adding another data store requires minimal changes.
- **PostgreSQL Repositories**: Handle CRUD operations on PostgreSQL tables. These repositories abstract SQL queries, providing a consistent interface for data operations regardless of the underlying database.

### Benefits of Database Abstraction
- **Flexibility**: The ability to use both MongoDB and PostgreSQL enables the system to take advantage of the strengths of both databasesâ€”scalability and schema flexibility from MongoDB and the reliability and integrity of relational data from PostgreSQL.
- **Scalability**: By abstracting database operations into repositories, the system can be scaled horizontally by distributing data between different databases.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the database schema or migration between databases are simplified due to the abstraction provided by repositories.

## API Integrations

### Overview
The **Infrastructure** layer of the application includes integrations with various external APIs, enabling the backend to interact with third-party services for different functionalities, such as file management, payments, and more.

### API Integration Services
- **AWS Integration (AWSHelper)**: The application uses `AWSHelper` to interact with AWS services, such as S3, for file management. This service abstracts all AWS-related logic, making it easier to manage file uploads and retrieval without needing to worry about the underlying AWS SDK.

#### Example: AWSHelper for File Management
The **AWSHelper** provides methods for uploading, downloading, and managing files in an S3 bucket. This abstraction hides the complexities of interacting with the AWS SDK and provides a simple API for the rest of the application.

```typescript
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

class AWSHelper {
    private s3: AWS.S3;

    constructor() {
        this.s3 = new AWS.S3({
            accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
            secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY,
        });
    }

    async uploadFile(bucketName: string, key: string, body: Buffer): Promise<void> {
        const params = {
            Bucket: bucketName,
            Key: key,
            Body: body,
        };
        await this.s3.upload(params).promise();
    }

    async getFile(bucketName: string, key: string): Promise<AWS.S3.GetObjectOutput> {
        const params = {
            Bucket: bucketName,
            Key: key,
        };
        return this.s3.getObject(params).promise();
    }
}
```

### HTTP Clients
The application also uses HTTP clients to communicate with external REST APIs. These clients are implemented as services and injected wherever needed using **Inversify** for dependency injection.

#### Example: BaseHTTPClient
The **BaseHTTPClient** service is used to make HTTP requests to external services. This could be useful for making calls to third-party APIs for payment processing, authentication, or data retrieval.

```typescript
import axios, { AxiosInstance } from 'axios';

class BaseHTTPClient {
    private client: AxiosInstance;

    constructor(baseURL: string) {
        this.client = axios.create({
            baseURL,
        });
    }

    async get(endpoint: string, params?: any): Promise<any> {
        return this.client.get(endpoint, { params });
    }

    async post(endpoint: string, data: any): Promise<any> {
        return this.client.post(endpoint, data);
    }
}
```
- **BaseURL Configuration**: Each instance of `BaseHTTPClient` can be configured with a different base URL, allowing easy management of multiple external services.
- **Error Handling**: The client can also include error-handling logic to ensure that failed requests are handled gracefully.

### Benefits of API Abstraction
- **Reusability**: By creating generic clients like `AWSHelper` and `BaseHTTPClient`, the application can reuse these components across multiple services, reducing redundancy.
- **Maintainability**: Centralizing API interactions in dedicated services makes the application more maintainable, as changes to an API or its authentication method can be updated in one place.
- **Dependency Injection**: Using **Inversify** to inject these services allows for better testing, as the services can be easily mocked during unit testing.

## Summary
This document outlines how the **Node Express Backend (TypeScript)** project handles database management and external API integrations. By leveraging a combination of **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**, the system gains flexibility and scalability. Repositories abstract data access, making the core application logic database-agnostic. The **Infrastructure** layer integrates with external APIs using services like `AWSHelper` and `BaseHTTPClient`, ensuring that the application is modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.

The architecture aims to provide:
- **Clean Database Abstraction**: Through repositories and connection managers.
- **Seamless API Integrations**: Using helpers and HTTP clients for easy interaction with third-party services.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: By combining different database technologies and providing modular integrations.
